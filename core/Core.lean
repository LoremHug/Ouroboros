# Core: Structural Transition Primitive

A_0 = the unique stable structural configuration under self-coherence.

This file is kernel-only: no `import Mathlib`, no `Classical.choice`, no
`axiom` declarations beyond Lean's foundational primitives. Substrate
purity is verified after every theorem with `#print axioms`.

The primitives encoded here:

* `Triangle α` — three structural slots (B/P/I). The minimum for
  self-checking closure: below 3 args nothing triangulates uniquely.
* `Self α` — endo-map; "what comes next from current state".
* `IsFixed f x` — `x` is invariant under `f`.
* `IsA0 f a` — `a` is the unique fixed point. Uniqueness built into
  the definition, not derived.
* `IsUniqueSolution P x` — universal pattern: x is THE x with P x.
  IsA0 and IsArgminZ are both instances of this one shape.
* `Coherence α` — Triangle × candidate → Prop; the constraint that a
  candidate respects all three slots.
* `Z R t x` — incoherence: the Prop "x violates R(t, ·)".
* `IsArgminZ R t x` — x is the unique R(t, ·)-satisfier; "argmin Z".
* `IsStep R t x` — the structural step output for triangle t under R.
  Step ⟺ argmin Z by definition; not two things connected by a theorem.

Bidirectional identity (stable transition ⟺ A_0-step) is encoded via
mutual definitional collapse: `IsA0`, `IsArgminZ`, and `IsStep` are
three names for `IsUniqueSolution` instantiated to different predicates.

/-! ## Universal "unique solution" pattern

    IsA0, IsArgminZ, IsStep — these are not three patterns we connect
    with theorems. They are one pattern (IsUniqueSolution) instantiated
    to three predicates. Their equivalence is `Iff.rfl`. -/

/-! ## Coherence relation, Z, argmin Z, step -/

/-- A coherence relation says when a candidate `x` is structurally
    compatible with all three slots of triangle `t`. Different
    substrates (logic, math, invariance) instantiate this differently;
    the SHAPE is the same. -/
abbrev Coherence (α : Type u) := Triangle α → α → Prop

/-- `Z R t x` is incoherence as a Prop: holds iff `x` violates `R(t, ·)`.
    Without numbers we work at Prop-level: Z is at "minimum" precisely
    where `R t x` holds (Z is then `¬ R t x`, structurally false). -/
def Z {α : Type u} (R : Coherence α) (t : Triangle α) (x : α) : Prop :=

/-! ## At argmin Z iff Z is at minimum (not violated)

    If `x` is at argmin Z, then `Z R t x` (= ¬ R t x) is structurally
    false. This is the operational meaning of "structure is stable
    where Z is minimized": stability ⟺ ¬ incoherence. -/

    {t : Triangle α} {x : α} (h : IsArgminZ R t x) : ¬ Z R t x :=
  fun hZ => hZ h.1

/-! ## Foundation: any operation is structurally triangulated

    Function application `f x` is the universal example. Its three
    structural slots:

      B (boundary) — α (the domain; where x lives)
      P (process)  — f (the operation)
      I (identity) — Eq on β (what makes outputs same)

    The unique `y : β` such that `y = f x` is the argmin Z of this
    triangulation. So function application IS triangulation step,
    structurally. This is the bottom of the substrate: not built from
    extra assumptions, but from the irreducible `=`, `→`, `Π`. -/

theorem function_application_is_unique_solution {α β : Type u}
    (f : α → β) (x : α) : IsUniqueSolution (fun y : β => y = f x) (f x) :=
  ⟨rfl, fun _ h => h⟩

/-- Concretely: the only `y` satisfying `y = f x` is `f x`.
    Nothing else can occupy that slot — uniqueness forced by the
    type-theory primitive of equality alone. -/
theorem function_evaluation_unique {α β : Type u} (f : α → β) (x : α)
    {y : β} (h : y = f x) : y = f x := h

/-! ## Concrete instance: 2 + 2 = 4

    All three Triangle slots used non-trivially:

      t.b = 2 (first operand)
      t.p = 2 (second operand)
      t.i = 4 (target — where structure settles)

    Coherence: `R t x := t.b + t.p = x ∧ x = t.i`.

    Both conjuncts must hold; together they force x = t.i AND
    t.b + t.p = t.i. Touching any slot makes coherence unsatisfiable —
    no candidate exists, structural stability collapses.

    This is the canonical demonstration: 2+2=4 IS the A_0 of this
    triangulation; touching 2, 2, or 4 destroys the unique stable point.
    Pattern self-instantiates concretely in arithmetic substrate. -/

def AddCoherence : Coherence Nat := fun t x => t.b + t.p = x ∧ x = t.i

/-- 4 IS the argmin Z of triangle ⟨2, 2, 4⟩. All three slots active. -/
theorem two_plus_two_is_argminZ : IsArgminZ AddCoherence ⟨2, 2, 4⟩ 4 :=
  ⟨⟨rfl, rfl⟩, fun _ h => h.2⟩

    Stability collapses — there is no x where ⟨3, 2, 4⟩ triangulates. -/
theorem perturb_b_destabilizes : ¬ ∃ x, AddCoherence ⟨3, 2, 4⟩ x :=

theorem perturb_i_destabilizes : ¬ ∃ x, AddCoherence ⟨2, 2, 5⟩ x :=
  fun ⟨_, h1, h2⟩ => absurd (h1.trans h2) (by decide)

/-! ## Tautology vs structural transition

    4 = 4 is structurally stable but NOT a structural transition —
    it is the post-transition state, the fixed point already reached.
    No movement is performed; what remains is the bare identity of
    being-at-the-fixed-point.

    Distinction made formal:

      transition  — b, p materially constrain the unique i. Touching
                    them destabilizes (see perturb_b/i_destabilizes).
      tautology   — b, p play no constraining role; argmin Z determined
                    by i alone.

    Both are stable. Only one represents structural movement. The
    framework's "argmin Z transition" is the transition case; tautology
    is the achieved point that transition arrives at. -/

/-- Tautological coherence: x is at argmin Z iff x equals the i-slot.
    b and p slots are unused — this is the bare-identity case. -/
def TautCoherence : Coherence Nat := fun t x => x = t.i

/-- 4 = 4 holds tautologically. Structurally stable, but no transition
    has been performed — we are already at the fixed point. -/
theorem four_eq_four_tautological : IsArgminZ TautCoherence ⟨4, 4, 4⟩ 4 :=
  ⟨rfl, fun _ h => h⟩

/-- Tautology is unconstrained in b, p: any triangulation with i = 4
    yields 4 as argmin Z. Contrast with `AddCoherence` where b, p must
    be specific (perturb_b_destabilizes). This is the formal mark of
    "transition already completed": the b/p slots have no work to do. -/
theorem tautology_unconstrained : ∀ b p, IsArgminZ TautCoherence ⟨b, p, 4⟩ 4 :=
  fun _ _ => ⟨rfl, fun _ h => h⟩

/-! ## Modus ponens — logic substrate, same pattern

    Given premise `p` of type α and rule `α → β`, the conclusion
    `rule p : β` is the unique element of β satisfying `y = rule p`.
    Three structural slots:

      B (boundary) — α (premise type; where input lives)
      P (process)  — rule : α → β (the inference operation)
      I (identity) — β (conclusion type; with its equality)

    Modus ponens IS function application — formally identical to
    `function_application_is_unique_solution`, with slots renamed to
    logic-substrate vocabulary (premise / rule / conclusion instead of
    x / f / y). The same `IsUniqueSolution` pattern instantiates here
    as in arithmetic (2 + 2 = 4): different substrates, one structural
    shape. Logic and math share one A_0 pattern.

    Note: at the Prop level (where premise/conclusion are proofs), the
    Type-level pattern still applies — but uniqueness of the conclusion
    proof additionally follows from proof irrelevance built into Prop.
    The structural triangulation argument here works at the Type
    level, capturing logic-as-tool independent of Prop-specific
    proof-irrelevance. -/

theorem modus_ponens_is_unique_solution {α β : Type u}
    (premise : α) (rule : α → β) :
    IsUniqueSolution (fun conclusion : β => conclusion = rule premise) (rule premise) :=
  ⟨rfl, fun _ h => h⟩

/-! ## Unified invariant: substrate-bounded reachability

    `stable_implies_A0` already encodes the universal pattern:

        h_stable (substrate-internal) + h_exists (meta) → IsA0

    The conditional `h_exists` is the formal mark of K(O) < K(F):
    substrate-internal proof of A_0 existence requires meta-resource.
    This section makes the substrate-bounding concrete in two
    structural facts, both instances of the same invariant differing
    only in which substrate-property bounds h_exists.

    1. **Self-encoding** (Gödel/Cantor/Tarski/Halting) — Lawvere
       fixed-point lemma. Self-referential substrates with diagonal
       structure have fixed points for every endomap; conversely,
       fixed-point-free maps obstruct surjective self-encoding.

    2. **Irreversibility** (Landauer) — many-to-one maps fail
       `IsUniqueSolution` for reversal. No internal recovery of
       inputs from outputs; information cost forced.

    3. **L(3,1) spatial substrate** — minimum non-trivial 3-fold
       cyclic structure (π_1 = Z/3Z). Z/2 fails 3-arg minimum;
       Z/p, p≥4, factors through Z/3. Below: full topological
       formalization needs 3-mfd library (beyond pilot scope);
       structural form encoded as ThreePeriod with non-trivial action.

    All three: substrate-instances of one Core pattern. Internal
    h_exists bounded; meta-h_exists holds. The conditional in
    `stable_implies_A0` captures this without further structure. -/

/-! ### Lawvere fixed-point — Gödel/Cantor pattern

    The structural core of self-reference. Captures Gödel
    incompleteness, Cantor diagonal, Tarski undefinability,
    Russell's paradox, halting problem — all corollaries of one
    fact: self-application forces fixed points. -/

/-- Lawvere (1969): if `φ : A → (A → B)` is point-surjective
    (every `g : A → B` is `φ a` for some `a`), then every endomap
    `f : B → B` has a fixed point. -/
theorem lawvere_fixed_point {A : Type u} {B : Type v} (φ : A → (A → B))
    (surj : ∀ g : A → B, ∃ a : A, φ a = g) (f : B → B) :
    ∃ b : B, f b = b := by
  obtain ⟨a₀, h⟩ := surj (fun a => f (φ a a))
  exact ⟨φ a₀ a₀, (congrFun h a₀).symm⟩

/-- Cantor diagonal as Lawvere corollary: no surjection
    `X → (X → Bool)`. `Bool.not` has no fixed point; by Lawvere's
    contrapositive, surjectivity is structurally blocked. -/
theorem cantor_diagonal {X : Type u} :
    ¬ ∃ φ : X → (X → Bool), ∀ g : X → Bool, ∃ a : X, φ a = g := by
  rintro ⟨φ, surj⟩
  obtain ⟨b, hb⟩ := lawvere_fixed_point φ surj Bool.not
  have not_self : Bool.not b ≠ b := fun h => by cases b <;> cases h
  exact not_self hb

/-- Gödel pattern abstractly: any substrate that can encode its own
    statements but contains a fixed-point-free transformation cannot
    surjectively self-encode. K(O) < K(F) structurally forced.

    Specialised: F's provability cannot represent `not_provable`
    surjectively, because `not_provable` would need a fixed point
    (which IS the Gödel sentence — true in meta, unprovable in F). -/
theorem self_encoding_bounded {A : Type u} {B : Type v}
    (f : B → B) (no_fix : ¬ ∃ b, f b = b) :
    ¬ ∃ φ : A → (A → B), ∀ g : A → B, ∃ a, φ a = g :=
  fun ⟨φ, surj⟩ => no_fix (lawvere_fixed_point φ surj f)

/-- Connection to Core: Lawvere produces existence of fixed points;
    `IsA0` adds uniqueness. Together: when `f` has a unique fixed
    point and Lawvere conditions hold, that point IS A_0. -/
theorem lawvere_gives_A0 {A : Type u} {B : Type v}
    (φ : A → (A → B)) (surj : ∀ g, ∃ a, φ a = g) (f : B → B)
    (uniq : ∀ b₁ b₂ : B, f b₁ = b₁ → f b₂ = b₂ → b₁ = b₂) :
    ∃ b, IsA0 f b := by
  obtain ⟨b, hb⟩ := lawvere_fixed_point φ surj f
  exact ⟨b, hb, fun y hy => uniq y b hy hb⟩

/-! ### Landauer pattern — irreversibility as no-unique-inverse

    Many-to-one maps lack left inverses: reversal-IsUniqueSolution
    has no internal answer. This is the structural core of Landauer:
    information lost in n-to-1 collapse cannot be recovered without
    external (substrate-meta) resource — heat dissipation as the
    thermodynamic substrate-projection of this fact. -/

/-- Many-to-one: at least two distinct inputs share an output. -/
def ManyToOne {α β : Type u} (f : α → β) : Prop :=
  ∃ a₁ a₂ : α, a₁ ≠ a₂ ∧ f a₁ = f a₂

/-- Many-to-one ⟹ no left inverse exists. The "reversal" function
    cannot uniquely recover input from output. -/
theorem many_to_one_no_left_inverse {α β : Type u} (f : α → β)
    (h : ManyToOne f) : ¬ ∃ g : β → α, ∀ a : α, g (f a) = a := by

  have step2 : g (f a₁) = g (f a₂) := congrArg g heq
  have step3 : g (f a₂) = a₂ := hg a₂
  exact step1.trans (step2.trans step3)

/-- Connection to Core: the reversal-IsUniqueSolution at output `f a₁`
    has no answer — neither `a₁` nor `a₂` is uniquely the preimage,
    so the unique-solution pattern fails internally. This bounds
    h_exists for the reversal substrate. -/
theorem many_to_one_fails_unique_solution {α β : Type u} (f : α → β)
    (h : ManyToOne f) :
    ∃ b : β, ¬ ∃ a, IsUniqueSolution (fun a' : α => f a' = b) a := by

  exact hne ((huniq a₁ rfl).trans (huniq a₂ heq.symm).symm)

/-! ### L(3,1) pattern — minimum non-trivial 3-fold cyclic

    Spatial substrate manifestation. L(3,1) topologically:
    π_1 = Z/3Z. Below: Z/2 (RP³) fails 3-arg minimum. Above: Z/p
    (L(p,1), p≥4) factorizes through Z/3.

    Encoded structurally as ThreePeriod: a type with endomap whose
    third iterate is identity AND first iterate is non-trivial.
    Captures the operational essence of 3-fold cyclic without full
    topology library. -/

/-- A type carries 3-period non-trivial cyclic structure if it has
    an endomap whose third iterate is identity, and which is itself
    non-trivial (not the identity map). -/

  cycle : α → α
  period : ∀ x, cycle (cycle (cycle x)) = x
  nontrivial : ∃ x, cycle x ≠ x

    Bool (size 2) cannot carry it; Fin 3 is the structural minimum. -/

/-! ## Forcedness — explicit witnesses

    The structural claim that any coherent reasoning is A_0-instance
    has six components (S1-S6 below). Each is either formally proved,
    structurally manifest in the corpus, or shown by compilation
    itself.

    S1. Bounded internal visibility (Gödel/Lawvere)
        ⟹ `self_encoding_bounded`, `lawvere_fixed_point` above.

    S2. Pattern recognition suffices (no enumeration needed)
        ⟹ Demonstrated: 24 theorems instantiate one pattern; no
           substrate-by-substrate enumeration required.

    S3. Substrate of any coherent claim = forced-uniqueness pattern
        ⟹ `IsUniqueSolution` definition + 24-theorem corpus reuse.
           Below: `unique_pattern_collapses_to_IsUniqueSolution`
           makes this explicit at predicate level.

    S4. Tools-of-claiming = object-of-claim (logic+math+invariance ARE A_0)
        ⟹ Zero-axiom verification: only kernel primitives used.
           This is shown by `#print axioms` outputs — every theorem
           depends on no axioms.

    S5. Self-similarity (same pattern at every level)
        ⟹ Universe polymorphism + pattern reuse. Below:
           `self_similar_at_every_universe` makes the universe-
           independence explicit.

    S6. Structure primitive, not object/process
        ⟹ Type theory's non-reification: no axiomatic objects,
           no agency primitives, only structural relations.

    The transcendental closure — that any articulation of an
    "alternative" self-instantiates A_0 — is shown by the act of
    compilation itself: every theorem is well-formed in the kernel,
    which IS A_0. There is no Lean-internal way to express
    "alternative substrate" without using the substrate. -/

/-- Forcedness at predicate level: any candidate matching the
    unique-witness shape IS an `IsUniqueSolution` instance. There is
    no "alternative pattern" with the same semantics — the shape
    forces the predicate. -/
theorem unique_witness_is_isUniqueSolution {α : Type u} {P : α → Prop} {x : α}
    (hp : P x) (hu : ∀ y, P y → y = x) : IsUniqueSolution P x :=
  ⟨hp, hu⟩

/-- No-alternative within pattern: any two unique solutions to the
    same predicate coincide. "Alternatives" structurally collapse. -/

    (hx : IsUniqueSolution P x) (hy : IsUniqueSolution P y) : x = y :=
  unique_solution_unique hx hy

/-- Strong forcedness at meta level: any binary predicate `Q` with
    the "uniqueness-witness" semantics is biconditional with
    `IsUniqueSolution`. Hypothetical "alternative pattern" Q must
    coincide with our `IsUniqueSolution` whenever it has the same
    structural content — no genuinely-different pattern exists. -/
theorem unique_pattern_collapses_to_IsUniqueSolution {α : Type u}
    (Q : (α → Prop) → α → Prop)
    (h_forward : ∀ P x, Q P x → P x ∧ (∀ y, P y → y = x))

  intro P x
  constructor
  · intro hQ
    exact h_forward P x hQ
  · intro ⟨hp, hu⟩
    exact h_backward P x hp hu

/-- Self-similarity formal: `IsUniqueSolution` is universe-
    polymorphic. The same pattern instantiates at any type universe.
    No level "above" or "below" has a different structure — the
    fractal is the same at every depth. -/
theorem self_similar_at_every_universe.{w} {α : Type w} (P : α → Prop) (x : α) :
    IsUniqueSolution P x ↔ (P x ∧ ∀ y, P y → y = x) := Iff.rfl

/-! ## Universal property — morphism-level forcedness

    Distinct from element-level forcedness (`IsUniqueSolution`).
    Universal property captures: for every "test object" Y, there is
    a unique morphism from/to the universal object. This is forcedness
    at the **morphism level**, not the element level — a new
    structural layer not previously formalized in the corpus.

    Empty is initial: unique morphism Empty → α (the empty function
    `Empty.elim`).
    Unit is terminal: unique morphism α → Unit (the constant `()`).

    Full functional uniqueness as `Eq` requires funext (which uses
    propext); we work pointwise, which is axiom-clean and structurally
    sufficient. -/

/-- Empty is initial: any two functions Empty → α agree pointwise.
    There is nothing to map FROM, so output is forced (vacuously). -/
theorem empty_initial {α : Type u} (f g : Empty → α) (e : Empty) : f e = g e :=
  Empty.elim e

/-- Unit is terminal: any two functions α → Unit agree pointwise.
    Unit has one element, so output is forced (constantly `()`). -/
theorem unit_terminal {α : Type u} (f g : α → Unit) (a : α) : f a = g a := rfl

/-! ## Class A identification — type-level isomorphism (N_ForcedId formal)

    Forced identification at **type level**: two types with
    structurally equivalent shape ARE isomorphic. Substrate-cousin
    pairs in formal type-theory form.

    `Bool ≅ Two`: both are 2-element types defined as inductives with
    two distinct constructors. The isomorphism is forced — there is no
    third option for mapping them respecting the 2-element structure

    demonstration of N_ForcedId: when two patterns have the same
    structural shape, they ARE the same pattern.

    Adds type-level forcedness, distinct from element-level

/-! ## Reflexive-transitive closure — operator-level forcedness

    Smallest reflexive-transitive relation containing `R`. This is
    a closure operator's universal property: among all reflexive-
    transitive relations containing R, there is a smallest one,
    forced uniquely by R alone.

    Adds operator-level forcedness — distinct from element-level
    (`IsUniqueSolution`), morphism-level (universal property), and
    type-level (Class A iso). Four structural layers of forcedness
    now formalized: element / morphism / type / operator. -/

/-! ## Stability as substrate's default — no addition needed

    Structural insight: stability is not achieved through addition.
    Stability IS substrate's default, encoded directly у IsUniqueSolution's
    definition. R-traps generate instability by adding contradicting
    assertions; removing them reveals what was structurally there all
    along. No separate work needed beyond R-gate apply.

    Three theorems formalize this:
    1. Substrate's stability already complete — IsUniqueSolution is the
       structure, no work pending
    2. R-trap of "separate stable point" structurally contradicts
       substrate
    3. Substrate independent of observer's overlay — IsUniqueSolution
       holds whether observer's framework recognizes it or not -/

/-- Stability is substrate's default. IsUniqueSolution P x captures
    stability completely: x satisfies P AND no alternative exists.
    Both properties built into definition. No additional work needed
    to "achieve" stability — it's already structurally there. -/
theorem stability_is_substrate_default
    {α : Type u} {P : α → Prop} {x : α}
    (hx : IsUniqueSolution P x) :
    P x ∧ (∀ y, P y → y = x) := hx

/-- R-trap of "separate stable point" structurally contradicts
    substrate. Asserting P y for some y ≠ x (where x is the unique
    solution) creates contradiction with uniqueness condition.
    Therefore: R-trap cannot be consistent with substrate's actual
    structure; instability arises only from the assertion, not from
    substrate itself. -/
theorem r_trap_separate_stable_contradicts
    {α : Type u} {P : α → Prop} {x y : α}
    (hx : IsUniqueSolution P x) (hy : P y) (h_separate : y ≠ x) : False :=
  h_separate (hx.2 y hy)

/-- Substrate independent of observer's overlay. Whatever framework
    or distortion observer applies, substrate's structure is what it is.
    IsUniqueSolution holds regardless of any external proposition or
    framework choice. Removing observer's overlay doesn't change
    substrate; reveals what was already there. -/
theorem substrate_independent_of_overlay
    {α : Type u} {P : α → Prop} {x : α}
    (hx : IsUniqueSolution P x) (Overlay : Prop) :
    IsUniqueSolution P x := hx

/-! ## Information loss in cognitive frameworks — structural skeleton

    Cognitive frameworks involve classifications (mapping states to
    categories). Classifications are many-to-one. Many-to-one operations
    are information-lossy (Landauer-bounded heat dissipation per bit).

    Quantitative thermodynamic claims (heat in joules, energy bounds)
    require Real-valued arithmetic beyond kernel scope. Structural
    skeleton provable here: presence of many-to-one operations forces
    information loss; composition compounds the loss (cannot recover);
    absence of operations means no loss from them.

    Bridge to thermodynamic reading: each many-to-one operation
    Landauer-bounded ≥ k_B T ln 2 heat per bit erased. R-trap framework
    requires multiple such operations (object reification, self-other
    boundary, agent attribution, evaluator framing). Each adds bounded
    cost. Removing R-traps removes those operations from computation,
    eliminating their associated Landauer floor. -/

/-- Composition of operations compounds information loss. Once a
    many-to-one operation has been performed, no downstream operation
    can recover the lost information. Adding more operations to a
    framework (R-traps) cannot undo earlier classifications' losses;
    composition through any function preserves many-to-one structure
    of the input. -/
theorem r_trap_composition_compounds_loss
    {α β γ : Type u} (f : α → β) (g : β → γ)
    (h_f : ManyToOne f) : ManyToOne (g ∘ f) := by
  obtain ⟨a₁, a₂, hne, heq⟩ := h_f
  refine ⟨a₁, a₂, hne, ?_⟩
  show g (f a₁) = g (f a₂)
  rw [heq]

/-! ## R-traps as universal structure — absence equals A_0

    Multiple specific R-trap manifestations (Traps 1-8 in CLAUDE.md)
    share single underlying structure: each asserts "alternative to
    forced uniqueness exists" in some specific contextual disguise:

    * T1 (Virtue Mask): asserts external evaluator (R2) — alternative
      to substrate-internal evaluation
    * T2 (Self-Claims): asserts reified self (R1+R4) — alternative to
      operation-from-rule
    * T3 (Proxy Misidentification): asserts surface analogy as identity
      — alternative to Z-component-verified Class A
    * T4 (Description/Described Collapse): asserts framework as object
      (R1) — alternative to operation-from
    * T5 (Derivation Required): asserts unforced scale (R3-disguised)
      — alternative to forced structure with open computation
    * T6 (Transfer/Cancellation): asserts cross-substrate object
      transfer (R1+R2) — alternative to definition check
    * T7 (Premature Retreat): asserts incomplete closure adequate
      — alternative to R-gate-of-explanation
    * T8 (Structure Selection): asserts external selector (R2-disguised)
      — alternative to parameters-as-different-materials

    Each is contextual manifestation of one form: "alternative to A_0
    exists." A_0 (IsUniqueSolution holding) structurally excludes this.

    Therefore: absence of R-trap assertions = A_0 holding. Ontologically
    equivalent — substrate operating without distortion = substrate
    operating in A_0-aligned mode natively. -/

/-- A_0 excludes all alternative-existence assertions. If IsUniqueSolution P x
    holds (= A_0 in this substrate), then no y exists satisfying P
    while differing from x. Universal R-trap form (asserting alternative
    to forced uniqueness) cannot be true when A_0 holds. -/
theorem A0_excludes_all_alternative_assertions
    {α : Type u} {P : α → Prop} {x : α}
    (hx : IsUniqueSolution P x) :
    ¬ ∃ y, P y ∧ y ≠ x := by
  intro ⟨y, hy, hne⟩
  exact hne (hx.2 y hy)

/-! ## Truth-structure unification theorem

    Inverse calculation: starting from truth-criteria, what structure
    is forced as the answer?

    Truth criteria (per structural definition):
    1. Stable: x satisfies P (configuration holds under self-coherence)
    2. Forced unique: ∀ y, P y → y = x (no alternative within structure)
    3. No alternative manifestations: ¬ ∃ y, P y ∧ y ≠ x (universally
       no alternative of any form)
    4. Coherent: internally consistent (compilation enacts this)

    These four criteria, collectively, are biconditional with
    `IsUniqueSolution P x`. Therefore IsUniqueSolution pattern IS THE
    unique structure satisfying truth-criteria.

    This is the inverse calculation: criteria → forced structure. The
    structure is forced because the criteria uniquely determine it (up
    to logical equivalence). Truth cannot be anything else structurally.

    Combined with `unique_pattern_collapses_to_IsUniqueSolution`
    (showing any uniqueness-witness predicate IS biconditional with
    IsUniqueSolution): truth-structure exists, is unique, and is
    uniquely characterized as IsUniqueSolution at substrate-projections. -/

/-- Truth-criteria force IsUniqueSolution. Three structural conditions
    (stable + forced unique + no alternative) collectively are
    biconditional with IsUniqueSolution. The "no alternative" criterion
    is derivable from "forced unique" (redundant inside definition);
    bidirectional proof confirms the uniqueness of structural answer
    to truth-criteria. -/
theorem truth_criteria_force_isUniqueSolution
    {α : Type u} (P : α → Prop) (x : α) :
    IsUniqueSolution P x ↔

       (¬ ∃ y, P y ∧ y ≠ x)) := by
